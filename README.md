## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes vary in fidelity depending on the stage of the design process and the level of detail required. The two main types are:

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes

**Description:**  
These are basic, sketch-like representations of a screen or layout. They are usually black-and-white or grayscale, using simple shapes (boxes, lines, and placeholders) to indicate content placement.

**Purpose:**  
- Focus on structure and flow rather than visuals.
- Quick to create and revise.
- Ideal for early brainstorming and stakeholder feedback.

**Typical Uses:**  
- Early in the design process.
- To validate layout and navigation ideas.
- During team discussions to align on structure.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes

**Description:**  
These are detailed and polished representations that closely resemble the final product. They often include actual content, branding, UI elements, typography, and sometimes basic interactions.

**Purpose:**  
- Specify exact design and functionality details.
- Serve as a blueprint for developers.
- Useful for client presentations or usability testing.

**Typical Uses:**  
- Later stages of the design process.
- Before or during development handoff.
- To test user interactions and visual hierarchy.

### What Type of Wireframe Is This?

**Type:** Low-Fidelity Wireframe

- Ideal for early feedback before refining the visuals and functionality.
